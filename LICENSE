Unless  otherwise stated, the  source code distributed  with this book
can   be  redistributed in source    or  binary form   so  long  as an
acknowledgment  appears in derived source   files. The citation should
list that the code comes from BOOK  by AUTHOR, published by O'Reilly &

There are a few exception to this licence, however: a few sources
herein are distributed according to the GNU General Public License,
version 2. You'll find a copy of the license in
/usr/src/linux/COPYING, and in other places in your filesystem. The
affected source files are:

	pci/pci_skel.c
	tty/tiny_serial.c
	tty/tiny_tty.c
	usb/usb-skeleton.c

The files in ./pci ./tty and ./usb inherit the GPL from the kernel
sources, as most of their code comes straight from the kernel
(usb-skeleton.c being part of the kernel source tree directly.)
